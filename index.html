<h1>Slabstick's First Internetpage</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Slabstick and this here is my very first Internetpage while I'm learning to become a full stack engineer.
    Until now I only learned the theory of Java and JavaScript and as that was very eye opening, learning only theory gets tiresome at some point.
    So now I dive into HTML and CSS so I can put my JS Skills into good use and create something that I can see.

    Thanks for reading.
